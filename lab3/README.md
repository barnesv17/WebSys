How is your markup semantically correct?
Are there any non-semantic elements that you needed for styling purposes? If you used divs and spans, this is where you would account for them. Explain why you used divs and spans as opposed to something else.
In your own words, how is the hCard information you added to your personal résumé page useful to both humans and machines trying to access your content? (This means that everyone must answer this question individually in the README file.)






Derek:
The hCard information added to the personal pages are useful for both humans and machines because the hCard clearly denotes each section of the contact information. Each tag represents a piece of contact information, which makes it easy for both humans and machines to attribute meaning to each part of the text. Address, name, organization, etc. are all clearly denoted.

Gabriel:
For humans trying to read the information, the hCard neatly presents all the contact information in a neat package where each section is clear for anyone to read. Machines can take advantage of the order to systematically record the contact data.

Kyle:
It enhances my resume because it presents all my contact info in one spot. The tags are semantically correct so it's easy for machines and humans to read.
