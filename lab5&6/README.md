### Extra Credit
What first comes to mind is the game Among Us. Whenever a user starts the application, the user's preferred name and color is used by default. Whenever a user begins a new game, the user's preferred gameplay settings (# of imposters, player speed, etc.) is used by default. Further, a user's stats are continuously added to, even if the player exits the application and comes back. These are great examples of other information we could store using WebStorage.

We would not want to store personal, private information. Not only will this strike users as an invasion of privacy, but it can leave their private information vulnerable to malicious attacks.
