Part 1: Semantic HTML

  In the part1 HTML file, we chose <section> tags to separate each song entry. Within each <section>, different
  parts of the song's information, such as "Track Name" and "Artist", are marked up as list items <li> of an unordered list <ul>.
  Album images are marked up as <img> with a fixed universal size.

  In this way, ten different songs are ordered with identical format and semantic tags, and HTML file is logically structured and understandable.

Part 2: XML
